Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## **Overview of Project**
Louise’s play “Fever” came close to her funding goal of $2,885.00 but failed.  She wants my help to determine how other plays did to become successful with hitting their funding goals.  I analyzed and sorted the Kickstarter data to provide her with ways that she can be successful in the future.  I had to help determine how these different campaigns fared with their launch date and their funding goals.  I also provided Louise with visual campaign outcomes broken down by their launch dated and their funding goals.
### Purpose
I will need to provide Louise with visual feedback with an understanding to assist her gain better knowledge of the dataset, so in the future she will be able to be successful with upcoming plays.
## **Analysis and Challenges**
In initially reviewing the data, I noticed that I needed to add a few columns so that I could get the results that I was looking.  For columns included, Percentage Funded, Average Donations, Parent Category, Subcategory, Date Created Conversion, Date Ended Conversion, and Years. <img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-09-15 at 1 33 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109715441/190519925-5717d04d-6415-4fbc-a2ee-a3421b1500e9.png">
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The Chart below is based on the outcomes on the launch date of all theater plays.  The month that the most successful outcomes, was the month of May but also had similar numbers of failed.  In addition, June, July, and October all had a similar number of failed plays as well. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109715441/190516397-ba765848-6c97-475c-92fc-d3e8009ba7b1.png) 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals 
The next chart shows the outcomes based on the goals funded of all theater plays.  The most successfully funded theater plays were smaller dollar goals, such as less than $1,000 at 75%.  Whereas the least successful, was $30,000 to $34,999 range. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109715441/190516456-815d9842-b924-4cc9-90ec-542c65783e21.png)
### Challanges and Difficulties Encountered 
- I had to figure out why my chart in my pivot table did not look like the example chart. - •	One of my formulas was missing some content which fixed my chart.  With this fix, my chart looked like the example.
## **Results**

### Conculsion Drawn from the Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- Launching the campaign at the right time is very important for it to be successful.  Launching in the Spring. - •	The length of the campaign is important as well to making sure to hit funding goals.
### Conclusion Drawn from the Outcomes Based on Goals
- Per the data gathered, we can conclude that Louise’s goal had a 72% chance of being successful.
### Limitations of the Dataset
- The results would be more accurate and relevant if the data provided was more updated.  This information was from 2009 – 2017.
### Recommendation for Possible Tables and/or Graphs
- Could have used stacked column chart which could have showed the Outcomes Based on Goals.
